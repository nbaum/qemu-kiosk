Currently required software:

 * socat      For connecting port 5901 to the chooser script. You could use (x)inetd.
 * zenity     For displaying messages.
 * vnc4server Tightvncserver doesn't work. Not sure why.
 * QEMU       For the virtual machines!
 * sh         It's what the scripts are written in.

Run ./listener to start up the listener, then use a VNC client to <host>:1.
